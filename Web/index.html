        <h2>Introduction to Monte Carlo Simulation</h2>
        <p>
            Monte Carlo simulation is named after the famous Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco, which is known for its games of chance.
            It is a computational technique that uses random sampling and statistical analysis to model and solve problems.
            By repeatedly sampling from probability distributions, Monte Carlo simulation allows us to estimate the behavior of complex systems or processes.

        <h2>Monte Carlo simulations and Machine learning algorithms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Monte Carlo simulations are a class of computational techniques that use random sampling to approximate and analyze complex systems or problems.</li>
            <li>While Monte Carlo simulations themselves are not typically considered machine learning algorithms, they can be combined with machine learning techniques to enhance their capabilities.</li>
            <li>It's important to note that the specific choice of machine learning algorithms in Monte Carlo simulations depends on the nature of the problem, the available data, and the objectives of the simulation.</li>
            <li>Different algorithms may be more suitable for different scenarios, and their selection should be based on careful analysis and experimentation.</li>
        </ul>
