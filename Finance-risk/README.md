# Quantitative Risk Analysis of Stock Portfolio Using Monte Carlo Simulation: A Case Study

Risk analysis is a process of assessing and evaluating potential risks and their impact on an organization, project, or decision-making. It involves identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing risks to make informed decisions on how to mitigate or manage them effectively.

Types of risks analyzed in the financial banking sector
1. Credit Risk
2. Market risk
3. Liquidity risk
4. Operational risk
5. Regulatory Risk
6. Reputational Risk

Financial Risk Analysis key steps:
- Risk Identification
- Risk Assessment
- Risk Measurement and Quantification
- Risk Monitoring and Reporting
- Risk Mitigation and Management
- Risk Communication and Governance
- Risk reduction strategies

For the purpose of calculating VaR and CVar, I have used Monte Carlo simulation for randomly selected stocks. (Normal and t-distributions are used for the simulation).
