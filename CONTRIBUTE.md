# Contributing to Monte Carl simulation repository

Welcome to the Monte Carl simulation repository! We appreciate your interest in contributing to our project. This document provides a brief overview of Monte Carlo simulations and their application to financial risk analysis.

## Monte Carlo Simulations

Monte Carlo simulation is a computational technique that uses random sampling to obtain numerical results. It has wide applications in various fields, including finance. In the context of financial risk analysis:

- **Definition**: Monte Carlo simulation involves running multiple simulations of a financial model with randomized input parameters. This helps in understanding the range of possible outcomes and assessing the associated risks.

- **Steps**: The basic steps of performing a Monte Carlo simulation for financial risk analysis include:
  1. Defining the financial model and its input parameters.
  2. Generating random values for the input parameters based on their distributions.
  3. Running simulations to calculate the corresponding output (e.g., portfolio returns, asset prices).
  4. Analyzing the distribution of output results to make informed decisions.
